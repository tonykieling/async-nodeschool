This is a currency converter, which uses two APIs to get information about country and currency.
In order to get the right outcome, it has to work synchronously.

In this project, it was possible to practice
1. Promise
2. async/await
3. export modules
4. axios
5. JSON
6. date formating
7. dotenv, among other things

Next step is to give it a react layer in order to present via web
